Traffic Flow Prediction using BP Neural Network Project for CPSC 4176 (Columbus State University)

GitHub has file limit sizes and our largest dataset is ~140mb in size. We used Google Collab (online version of Jupyter Notebook) to conduct most of our work.

Dataset: http://www.seutraffic.com/#/download

In order to run our code, you would need to download the file and use either Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook.
Jupyter Notebook is recommended due to Google Collab having a 90 minute idle time out and a hard 12 hour time out. Some of the models take several hours to complete and the entire notebooks can take 6-12 hours depending on the computer hardware. We also noted Google Collab, even Premium GPU, did not perform better than our personal computers.
